    <p class="fw-bold fs-3">Introduction to bio-Strips</p>

    <p class="lead">A bio-Strip of a chemical reaction is a multi-sectioned strip (Figure 1),
        in which the length of the sections corresponds to the “normalized cytotoxicity” (NC)
        of the substances:</p>

    $$NC = {n \over CC_{50}}\ (1)$$

    <p class="fw-normal">Where <i>n</i> is the amount (mmol) of a given substance in a given reaction, and
        CC<sub>50</sub> (mmol/L) is a half-maximal cytotoxicity concentration of a given substance measured
        in a given cell line. Since lower CC<sub>50</sub> values reflect higher cytotoxicity, longer sections
        in the bio-Strip imply higher contributions of such substances to the “overall cytotoxicity”
        of the reaction.</p>

    <p class="lead">The color of the sections in bio-Strips corresponds to the CC<sub>50</sub> of a given
        substance in a given cell line. The substance with the lowest CC<sub>50</sub> value (highest cytotoxicity)
        is colored red, the substance with the highest CC<sub>50</sub> value (lowest cytotoxicity) is colored
        green, and all the other substances are colored intermediate shades of red, orange, yellow,
        and green. The color distribution in the cytotoxicity scale can correspond to the percentile
        distribution of the CC<sub>50</sub> values or to the linear distribution of the CC<sub>50</sub> values
        (the former variant is more artificial but it allows producing more “colorful” bio-Strips
        with a higher diversity of section colors).</p>

    <p class="lead">In Figure 1, the reaction is shown above the bio-Strips, whereas the cytotoxicity
        scale and explanations of the reaction name and abbreviations are shown below. Each bio-Strip
        is supplied with a bio-Factor (BF), which shows the change of the “overall cytotoxicity”
        of a particular reaction upon its course:</p>
    $$BF = {\sum NC_{out} \over \sum NC_{in}} = {\sum {n \over CC_{50}(out)} \over \sum {n \over CC_{50}(in)}}\ (2)$$
    <p class="fw-normal">Where <i>in</i> and <i>out</i> designate the substances entering (starting materials,
        catalysts, solvents and other reagents) or leaving (products, byproducts and chemicals that
        can be recycled, such as catalysts and solvents) the reaction, accordingly. BF >1 corresponds
        to an increased “overall cytotoxicity”, whereas BF < 1 corresponds to a decreased overall
        cytotoxicity”.</p>

    <p class="lead">Figure 1 shows bio-Strips for six exemplary routes of synthesis of
        4-nitro-1,1’-biphenyl. In these six reactions, the same starting material 2 (SM2, 1-iodo-4-nitrobenzene)
        and reagent (R, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) is used, as reflected by the first and third letters (A) in the
        reaction name, whereas the catalyst (CT) and solvent (S) vary: CT = Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub> (A), PdCl<sub>2</sub> (B),
        or Pd(acac)<sub>2</sub> (C) (the second letter in the reaction name), and S = ethanol (A) or NMP (B)
        (the fourth letter in the reaction name). These bio-Strips readily demonstrate that catalysts A
        (Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub>) and B (PdCl<sub>2</sub>) and solvent (A) (ethanol) are preferable from the viewpoint of the
        “overall cytotoxicity” of these synthetic routes.</p>

    <p class="text-center fw-normal">Figure 1.<span class ="text_center fw-light"> bio-Strips
        for synthesis of 4-nitro-1,1’-biphenyl upon varying starting material 2
        (SM2: 1-iodo-4-nitrobenzene (A), 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (B), or 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene (C)),
        catalyst (CT: Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub> (A), PdCl<sub>2</sub> (B), or Pd(acac)<sub>2</sub> (C)),
        reagent (R: Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (A), K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (B),
        or Cs<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (C)), and solvent (S: ethanol (A) or NMP (B)).
        The reaction is shown above the bio-Strips, whereas the cytotoxicity scale and
        explanations of the reaction name and abbreviations are shown below. In the bio-Strips,
        the length of the sections corresponds to the “normalized cytotoxicity” (NC) of the substances,
        and the color of the sections corresponds to the CC<sub>50</sub> value of a given substance in a given
        cell line (in this case - CaCo-2). Note that here, the cytotoxicity scale is colored
        in accordance with the percentile distribution of the CC<sub>50</sub> values. bio-Factors (BFs)
        are provided below the bio-Strips. Only 6 out of 36 bio-Strips are shown for clarity.</span></p>

    <p class="lead">In addition to BFs, cytotoxicity potentials for each bio-Strip are calculated:
        CP<sub>i</sub> (initial cytotoxicity potential, or CP of the substances entering the reaction);
        CP<sub>f</sub> (final cytotoxicity potential, or CP of the substances leaving the reaction),
        and CP<sub>f_rel</sub> (relative final cytotoxicity potential, or CP of the substances leaving
        the reaction except for the target product). In essence, CPs show the quantity of
        the liters of the cell media that can be “poisoned” by the corresponding substances:</p>

    $$CP_i = {\sum NC_{in}}\ (3)$$
    $$CP_f = {\sum NC_{out}}\ (4)$$
    $$CP_{f\_rel} = {\sum NC_{out} - NC_{product}}\ (5)$$

    <p class="lead">In the case of CPs, lower values correspond to reactions with lower
        “overall cytotoxicity”. Thus, by looking at the initial and final CPs of various
        synthetic routes for a particular target product, we can suggest the safer ones without
        looking at CC<sub>50</sub> values of the individual substances involved.</p>
